# Frugal-CIS-Control-Implementation

Kudos to Phil Townsend for the original inspiration of this series (http://philtownsend.net/2019/02/14/budgetless-cis-top-20-introduction/).

Standard disclaimer: this is objectively 'not-best-practise' advice that should only be used in lieu of hiring a security consultant. Similarly,
the objective of implementing this advice is to provide ideas for how to creatively implement common security controls on a very low budget.
The intent is for small businesses to have some form of defences rather than nothing.
